Our project essentially consisted of 5 stages: Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, then a model 
comparing three factors to how well each could predict our target, price.

Tha factors were square footage, which was refined to look exclusively at the indoor square footage of 
the properties as the best explanatory variable, latitude/longtitude and zipcode.
